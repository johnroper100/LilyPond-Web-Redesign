<h2 class="unnumberedsec">Google Summer of Code</h2>

<div class="column-center-top"><a name="What-is-Google-Summer-of-Code_003f"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">What is Google Summer of Code?</h3>

<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc">GSoC</a> is a global
program that offers students stipends to write code for free software
and open source projects during the summer.  It is an excellent
opportunity for students to gain experience with real-world software
development and make a contribution that benefits everyone.  It brings
new contributors to LilyPond and enables students who are already
involved to become more involved.  LilyPond participates in GSoC as part
of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</a>.
</p>
<p>We have had GSoC participants in 2012, 2015 and 2016 and encourage students
to apply for future summers.
</p>
<p>If you have questions or would like to apply, send us an email on our
developer mailing list (see <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>).
</p>

</div>
<div class="column-center-middle-color2"><a name="Project-Ideas-List"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Project Ideas List</h3>

<p>Below is a list of suggested projects for GSoC or for anyone who is
interested in helping to improve LilyPond. (Last updated: November 2016)
</p>
<p>Mentor availability varies from project to project and from year to year.
Send us an email on our developer mailing list (see <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>), and
we will help you find a mentor for a project that fits your interests
and skills.
</p>
<p>If you have ideas for a GSoC project that is not listed below you can
send us an email as well.  There are a number of areas where LilyPond
could be improved, and our development team is always willing to help
those who would like to tackle a project like those listed below.
</p>
<p>A full list of all the current open issues can be found
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/testlilyissues/issues">here</a>.
</p>

</div>
<div class="column-center-middle-color3"><a name="Improve-internal-chord-structure"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Improve internal chord structure</h3>

<p>The internal representation of LilyPond chords is not powerful enough
to capture the nomenclature of jazz chords.  Currently the chord has
a root, a bass and an inversion.  It would be nice to be able to handle
stacked or polychords, minor/major, etc.  In order to do this, an
internal representation with the ability to capture the essence of
complex chords must be developed.  As a bonus, once the internal
representation is developed, the output formatting of chord names can
be improved.
</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy/medium
<strong>Requirements:</strong> Scheme (Guile), but the level necessary can be
easily learned
<strong>Recommended:</strong> Chord theory and naming
<strong>Mentor:</strong> Carl Sorensen
</p>

</div>
<div class="column-center-middle-color3"><a name="Adding-variants-of-font-glyphs"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Adding variants of font glyphs</h3>

<div class="keep-bullets"><ul>
<li>
Adding &lsquo;on&rsquo; and &lsquo;between&rsquo; staff-line variants.

</li><li>
Shorter and narrower variants of some glyphs for example, accidentals.
Another, more specific example could be an ancient notation breve
notehead coming in two variants one with a small or big &lsquo;hole&rsquo; within
it.

</li></ul>

</div>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> easy
<strong>Requirements:</strong> MetaFont, C++, good eye for details
<strong>Recommended knowledge:</strong> basic LilyPond knowledge
<strong>Mentor:</strong> Werner Lemberg
</p>

</div>
<div class="column-center-middle-color3"><a name="Grace-notes"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Grace notes</h3>

<p>Fix problems with synchronization of grace notes.  Grace notes can
interfere with LilyPond&rsquo;s timing and cause odd effects, especially when
multiple staffs are used where some have grace notes and others don&rsquo;t.
This is one of the longest-standing and one of the more embarrassing
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/testlilyissues/issues/34">bugs</a> in
LilyPond.
</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> medium
<strong>Requirements:</strong> C++, MIDI
<strong>Recommended:</strong> familiarity with LilyPond internals
<strong>Potential Mentors:</strong> Mike Solomon (not available for GSoC 2016),
Carl Sorensen
</p>

</div>
<div class="column-center-middle-color3"><a name="Improve-default-beam-positioning"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Improve default beam positioning</h3>

<p>For regular, cross-staff, broken and kneed beams.  Beaming should depend
on context and neighbor notes (see section 2.2 of
<a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Repository_of_Music-Notation_Mistakes_%28Coulon%2C_Jean-Pierre%29">this book</a>).  If possible also reduce beaming-computation time.
</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> medium
<strong>Requirements:</strong> C++, experience with writing heuristics
<strong>Recommended knowledge:</strong> aesthetic sense
<strong>Potential Mentors:</strong> Mike Solomon (not available for GSoC 2016),
Carl Sorensen
</p>

</div>
<div class="column-center-middle-color3"><a name="Help-improve-compilation-behavior"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Help improve compilation behavior</h3>

<p>Automatic code analysis tools, like valgrind memory leak detection or
callgrind code profilers, provide valuable information about possible
flaws in our C++ code.  Cleaning up warnings would allow us to automate
the rejection of any patch which introduced extra warnings.
</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> medium
<strong>Requirements:</strong> C++
<strong>Potential Mentors:</strong> Reinhold Kainhofer (not available for GSoC
2016), Joe Neeman
</p>

</div>
<div class="column-center-middle-color3"><a name="MusicXML"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">MusicXML</h3>

<p>Improving MusicXML import and export functions:
</p>
<div class="keep-bullets"><ul>
<li>
Handle basic musical content export like the MIDI export (i.e. using
dedicated exporter classes, derived from the translator class).

</li><li>
Build the XML tree of the basic musical content, add a connection from
music event to XML tag.

</li><li>
Let all LilyPond engravers do their job.

</li><li>
Link each output object (i.e. each stencil or group of stencils) to the
music cause (and thus to the XML tag in the XML tree).

</li><li>
Add an XML output backend, which can then add layout information for
each output object to the XML tags.

</li></ul>

</div>
<p>There are several possibilities for this project, including building upon
the MusicXML export project from GSoC 2015.
</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> medium
<strong>Requirements:</strong> MusicXML, Python, Scheme, basic LilyPond knowledge
<strong>Potential Mentors:</strong> Reinhold Kainhofer, Mike Solomon (both not
available for GSoC 2016)
</p>
<p>Familiarity with other scorewriters (for cross-testing) would also help.
</p>

</div>
<div class="column-center-middle-color3"><a name="Improve-slurs-and-ties"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Improve slurs and ties</h3>

<p>The engraving quality of slurs and ties is often unsatisfactory. Ties
&lsquo;broken&rsquo; by clef or staff changes are not handled well.  The project
could include collecting and sorting examples of bad output, deciding on
the intended output and writing code to improve them.
</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> hard
<strong>Requirements:</strong> C++, experience with writing heuristics
<strong>Recommended knowledge:</strong> LilyPond knowledge, aesthetic sense
<strong>Potential Mentors:</strong> Mike Solomon, Janek Warcho≈Ç (both not available for
GSoC 2016)

we depend on an external entity here, which we cannot control.  Suppose
we go from 2.15.x to 2.17.x and put the documentation under "v2.17".
For some time, Google won't have the new location in its index, so the
