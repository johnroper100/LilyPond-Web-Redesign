@subheading 我们的目标

@imageFloat{flat-design,png,right}

LilyPond 是怎么来的呢？从前，有两位音乐家，对于那种用电脑打谱的、看上去了无生气的乐谱，很是懊恼，希望超越现状。既然音乐家们都喜爱阅读漂亮的乐谱，那为什么程序员不能写出可以制作优雅乐谱的软件呢？

于是，LilyPond
诞生了！这个系统把音乐家从繁琐的排版细节中释放出来，让他们能够专注于音乐制作。LilyPond
与音乐家携手，秉承古典音乐传统雕版印刷术最优良的传统，共同打造具有最高出版质量的乐谱。

@subheading 优雅
@subsubheading 杰出的古典雕版风格

@imageFloat{flat-design,png,right}

LilyPond allows musicians to produce elegant sheet music that is
easy to read.  Its developer community has spent thousands of hours
developing powerful music engraving software that results in beautifully
engraved music.  All of LilyPond's style settings, font designs and
algorithms have been inspired by the finest hand-engraved music.
LilyPond output has the same strong, balanced and elegant look as the
best-engraved classical scores.  This is further explained in our
@ref{Essay}.



@subsubheading 有效的版面选择

Spend less time with tweaking the output; LilyPond gets the
formatting correct right from the start.  It determines spacing by
itself, and breaks lines and pages to provide a tight and uniform
layout.  Clashes between lyrics, notes, and chords are resolved
and slurs and beams are sloped, automatically!


@divEnd

@divClass{color2}
@subheading 易于使用

@imageFloat{lilypond-book,png,right}

@subsubheading 基于文本的输入

LilyPond takes ASCII input, which you can produce in your favorite
text editor, quickly and comfortably.  The input contains all the
information, so there is no need to remember complex command sequences:
simply save a file for later reference.

@subsubheading 音乐和文本混合

Put fragments of music into texts without cutting and pasting
pictures.  Integrate music into @LaTeX{} or HTML seamlessly, or add
music to OpenOffice.org with OOoLilyPond.  Plugins are also available
to allow LilyPond code in various blogs and wikis, making online
collaboration possible.


@subsubheading 易用性

Text-based input also makes score-writing possible for users with
severe physical disabilities.  Dexterity-impaired users who are
unable to type or control a computer mouse can use
speech-recognition software to edit LilyPond files.  Even users
who are totally blind can use screen-reading software to write
LilyPond files -- an impossible task in graphical-based
score-writing programs.

@subsubheading 可扩展的设计

All settings can be changed to suit your personal typographical
taste.  If that still is not enough, there is always the built-in
scripting language Scheme, a dialect of the powerful language
LISP.  Settings, variables and functions are all documented in the
comprehensive program reference manual.

@divEnd

@divClass{color3}

@subheading 环境

@imageFloat{frescobaldi-lilypond-editor-small,png,right}

@subsubheading 免费的自由软件

LilyPond 是可以免费下载的！没错，是完全免费的，可从下载页获取。

它也是自由软件。It comes with source
code, and permission to change and copy it.  So, are you irritated
by a bug, or yearning for a feature? Simply add it yourself, or
pay someone else to do it.


@subsubheading 出色的支持

LilyPond runs on all popular platforms: GNU/Linux, Mac OS@tie{}X, and
Windows.  LilyPond comes with extensive documentation and 数以百计的范例文件。There is an active user community answering
questions on the lilypond-user mailing list, while the development
team makes sure that problems are solved quickly.


@subsubheading 强大的编辑器


Several developers, themselves active LilyPond users, have also
written tools specifically aimed at making the process of editing
LilyPond files faster and more effective.  For some examples, see
@ref{Easier editing}.

@translationof Examples

LilyPond is a powerful and flexible tool for engraving tasks of
all kinds.  Please browse our gallery of examples and be inspired!


@newsItem
@subsubheading 古典音乐

This organ work by J.S. Bach is a fairly typical engraving project
in LilyPond.

@exampleImage{bach-bwv610}

@newsItem
@subsubheading 复杂的乐谱 Complex Notation

This example from @emph{Goyescas} by Enrique Granados shows some
of the more advanced features of typesetting, including kneed
beams, cross-staff stems, and voice-follow lines.

@exampleImage{granados}
@newsEnd

@newsItem
@subsubheading 早期音乐

LilyPond also supports various types of ancient notation, such
as this passage of Gregorian chant.

@exampleImage{ancient-headword}
@newsEnd

@newsItem
@subsubheading 现代音乐

Contemporary composers find LilyPond well-suited to displaying
unusual notation.  Here is an excerpt from Trevor Bača's
@emph{Čáry}, for unaccompanied bass flute.

@exampleImage{cary}
@newsEnd


@newsItem
@subsubheading 有效，灵活地创造表演材料

Various performance materials can be created from the same source
code.  This is an excerpt of @uref{http://nicolas.sceaux.free.fr/,
Nicolas Sceaux's} engraving of Handel's @emph{Giulio Cesare}, in
full score, piano-vocal reduction, and a violin part.

@exampleImage{sesto-full}

@exampleImage{sesto-piano}

@exampleImage{sesto-violin}

@newsEnd

@newsItem
@subsubheading TAB 吉他谱 (Tablature)

LilyPond 支持 TAB 吉他谱 (六线谱)，which can be customized to
suit any instrument that reads from tablature.  The tablature
staff is generated automatically from notes entered for the 5-line
staff.

@exampleImage{tab-example}
@newsEnd

@newsItem
@subsubheading 申克分析图

Standard output can be modified heavily.  Here is an impressive
Schenkerian analysis, created by Kris Schaffer, for an article
in @uref{http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8364 , Linux Journal}.
The colors have been added for better visibility.

@exampleImage{bach-schenker}
@newsEnd

@newsItem
@subsubheading 声乐作品

LilyPond is excellent for vocal music of all kinds, from sacred
hymns to opera.  Here is a 中世纪经文歌 with slightly unusual
requirements.  The tenor voice is written in a different meter
than the others, but must line up as if it were in the same meter.
LilyPond handles this most elegantly.  Note also the incipits with
Vaticana style clefs, the slashed stems indicating plicated notes,
and the ligature braces above certain groups of notes.

@exampleImage{aucun-snippet}

@subsubheading 教育方面的应用

LilyPond 同样非常适合用于教育用途。

@subsubheading 流行音乐

It is simple to create pop lead sheets with melody, lyrics,
chord names, and fretboards.  In this example you see some of the
predefined fretboard diagrams, but these can be heavily customized
to suit nearly any situation.

@exampleImage{chart}
@newsEnd

@newsItem
@subsubheading 大型项目

LilyPond is excellent for large projects like operas or works for
full symphony orchestra, as well.  In addition, the text-based
input provides greater accessibility -- this example was
contributed by Hu Haipeng, a blind composer.

@uref{http://www.gnu.org/, GNU} LilyPond is written and maintained
by a community of enthusiasts.  It is published under the

@subheading 使用者的好处在哪？

@itemize

@item
No cost: download and try it out!  What do you have to lose?

@item
Sharing: if you like the program, give a copy to 您的朋友，
老师、学生和同事！

@item
Source available: if you are curious about how LilyPond creates
some notation, you can see exactly how it is done.

@item
Extendible: you can add features, fix bugs, and change the
functionality.  If you are not a programmer, you can hire somebody
to do those tasks.

This may not seem appealing to casual musicians, but the ability
to extend software can be highly valuable to serious composers,
companies, and academics.

@item
Future safety: if a commercial company goes bankrupt, what happens
to any electronic music which depends on their products?  This is
not a concern with LilyPond; even if the entire development team
quits (extremely unlikely), the program will still be legally
available for copying, modifications, and distribution.

@subheading 为什么 LilyPond 的开发者会无偿 @qq{赠送} 他们的工作？

Most of us view LilyPond development as a hobby or volunteer work.
So this question is really asking @qq{why do people volunteer}?

@itemize

@item
Fun: working towards a goal can be enjoyable, especially when you
work as a team!

@item
Shared goals: we all want beautiful sheet music, but few people
have the expertise (and nobody has the time!), to create a program
which can handle all situations.  By working together -- one
person improves the automatic beaming code, another person
improves the shape of slurs, and a third person writes
documentation explaining how to use these features -- we can
achieve our goal with only a fraction of the individual effort.

@item
@qq{Gift culture}: the Free Software
movement has created many great software projects, such as
@uref{http://kernel.org/, GNU/Linux},
@uref{http://www.getfirefox.com/, Mozilla Firefox}, and
@uref{http://www.wesnoth.org/, Battle for Wesnoth}.  Having
benefitted from these projects, some developers want to @qq{give
back} to the community.

@item
Work experience: contributing to free software projects is a great way to
practice programming, documentation writing, documentation translation,
or design.  This experience has helped some developers gain job offers
or scholarships.

because the first score I saw was so amazing! The description of
LilyPond lies about its beautifulness, it is too modest! [..] as
LilyPond is getting always better, and as I look closer how things
are done in scheme, I have less and less frustrations.  Anyway,
what I mean is: thank you for providing LilyPond, it is really

@c TRANSLATORS, so far it's mostly from
@c http://lilypond.org/web/switch/howto

@subheading @qq{编译} 音乐

@imageClickable{nereid-shot-small,png, (click to enlarge), nereid-shot,png, right}

LilyPond is a @emph{compiled} system: it is run on a text file
describing the music.  The resulting output is viewed on-screen or
printed.  In some ways, LilyPond is more similar to a programming
language than graphical score editing software.

You do not write music by dragging notes from a graphical toolbar
and placing them on a dynamically refreshing score; you write
music by typing text.  This text is interpreted (or @qq{compiled})
by LilyPond, which produces beautifully engraved sheet music.

People accustomed to graphical user interfaces might need to learn
a new way of working, but the results are definitely worth it!

@warning{We present a quick overview of our text input -- it's not
as complicated as it sounds!  Don't worry about understanding
every detail in these examples; our beginner documentation covers
everything at a much more gradual pace.}


@subsubheading 就像 A B C 一样简单

Notes are encoded with letters and numbers.  Special commands are
entered with backslashes.

@imageFloat{text-input-1-annotate,png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-1-output,png,center}

Alterations are made with different names: add @w{@code{-is}} for
sharp, and @w{@code{-es}} for flat (these are Dutch note names, other
languages are available).  LilyPond figures out where to put
accidentals.

Put chords and lyrics together to get a lead sheet:

@imageFloat{text-input-pop-annotate,png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-pop-output,png,center}



@subsubheading 配器部分

The input file contains the notes of piece of music.  Score and
parts can be made from a single input file, so that changing a
note always affects the score and parts.  To be able to include
the same music in multiple places, the music is assigned to a
@qq{variable} (a name).

@imageFloat{text-input-parts-both-annotate,png,center}


This variable is then used in a single part (here transposed, with
condensed rests spanning several measures):

@imageFloat{text-input-parts-single-annotate,png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-parts-single-output,png,center}


The same variable is used in the full score (here in concert
pitch):

@imageFloat{text-input-score-annotate,png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-score-output,png,center}


@subsubheading 初学者的文档

We realize that many users find this way of entering music a bit
odd.  For this reason, we have written extensive documentation to
help new users, beginning with @ref{Learning}.  The Learning
Manual is the best place to start, as many questions are answered
before they come up!

Please read the Learning Manual before complaining about bugs!
New users occasionally believe that LilyPond is not working
correctly, when in fact it is working precisely as designed.

More in-depth information is available in @ref{Manuals}.


@subsubheading 更简单的编辑环境

@imageClickable{lilykde-screenshot-small,png,
  (click to enlarge),lilykde-screenshot,png,right}

LilyPond is primarily concerned with producing top-quality
engraved sheet music; creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
would distract us from this goal.  However, there are other
projects aimed at making it easier to create LilyPond input files.

Some editing environments include syntax highlighting, automatic
command completion, and pre-made templates.  Other programs
actually provide a GUI which allows direct manipulation of a
graphical score.  For more information, see @ref{Easier editing}.

Denemo is a graphical editor which generates LilyPond source code,
and also allows audio playback.  It allows users to view the
LilyPond source code in parallel to the graphical view.  Extra
LilyPond tweaks can be attached to notes, chords etc. and are stored
with the Denemo file, so that users can continue to edit graphically.

Moving the cursor in the LilyPond text moves the cursor in the graphical
view, and any syntax errors in your LilyPond tweaks are highlighted in
the text view when printed from there.

Emacs is a text editor with language-sensitive capabilities for
many different computer languages.  Emacs is a highly extensible
editor and can be used as an Integrated Development Environment.
There is a @q{lilypond mode} which supplies the language
definitions for working with LilyPond source files.  As well, one of
our developers has written

@uref{http://www.vim.org}

Vim is a minimal text editor and is an extension of the older Unix
@command{vi} editor.  It is also extensible and configurable.

As a general rule, if you are not already familiar with Emacs or
Vim, then you would probably prefer to use a different editor for
writing LilyPond input files.

More information on setting up Emacs and Vim can be found in
@rprogram{Text editor support}.

@subheading 然后呢？

You are now ready to @ref{Download, Download LilyPond}.

Still not convinced?  Many composers, musicians, and conductors
have learned how to write music in our input format.  Experienced
users even report that they can enter a full score in LilyPond
faster than with a piano keyboard or mouse+GUI!  Perhaps you would
like to review the @ref{Features}, @ref{Examples}, or the
@ref{Freedom} that LilyPond provides, or read about users'
@ref{Productions} and @ref{Reviews}.  In addition, our
approach to the computational aesthetics of classical engraving is
explained in our @ref{Background}.
