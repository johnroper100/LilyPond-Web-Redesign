Scores of large ensemble works often have bar numbers placed beneath
the system, centered horizontally on the measure's extent.  This
snippet shows how the @code{Measure_counter_engraver} may be used to
simulate this notational practice.  Here, the engraver has been added
to a @code{Dynamics} context.
