All @code{DynamicLineSpanner} objects (hairpins and dynamic texts) are
placed with their reference line at least @code{'staff-padding} from
the staff, unless other notation forces them to be farther. Setting
@code{'staff-padding} to a sufficiently large value aligns the dynamics.

The same idea, together with @code{\\textLengthOn}, is used to align
the text scripts along their baseline.
