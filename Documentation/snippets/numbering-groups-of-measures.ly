This snippet demonstrates the use of the
@code{Measure_counter_engraver} to number groups of successive
measures.  Any stretch of measures may be numbered, whether consisting
of repetitions or not.


The engraver must be added to the appropriate context.  Here, a
@code{Staff} context is used; another possibility is a @code{Dynamics}
context.


The counter is begun with @code{\\startMeasureCount} and ended with
@code{\\stopMeasureCount}.  Numbering will start by default with
@code{1}, but this behavior may be modified by overriding the
@code{count-from} property.


When a measure extends across a line break, the number will appear
twice, the second time in parentheses.
