This method prints two 'rehearsal marks' - one above the stave and one
below, by creating two voices, adding the Rehearsal Mark engraver to
each voice - without this no rehearsal mark is printed - and then
placing each rehearsal mark UP and DOWN in each voice respectively.

This method (as opposed to method 1) is more complex, but allows for
more flexibility, should it be needed to tweak each rehearsal mark
independently of the other.
