For improvisations or taqasim which are temporarily free, the time
signature can be omitted and @code{\\cadenzaOn} can be used.  Adjusting
the accidental style might be required, since the absence of bar lines
will cause the accidental to be marked only once.  Here is an example
of what could be the start of a hijaz improvisation:

"
  doctitle = "Arabic improvisation"
} % begin verbatim

\include "arabic.ly"

\relative sol' {

  \accidentalStyle forget
  \cadenzaOn
