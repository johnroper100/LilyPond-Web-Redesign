Individual note heads in a chord can be modified with the
@code{\\tweak} command inside a chord, by altering the @code{font-size}
property.


Inside the chord (within the brackets @code{< >}), before the note to
be altered, place the @code{\\tweak} command, followed by
@code{#'font-size} and define the proper size like @code{#-2} (a tiny
note head).
