Some grobs can be accessed “laterally” from within another grob’s
callback. These are usually listed as “layout objects” in the “Internal
properties” section of a grob-interface. The function ly:grob-object is
used to access these grobs.


Demonstrated below are some ways of accessing grobs from within a
NoteHead callback, but the technique is not limited to NoteHeads.
However, the NoteHead callback is particularly important, since it is
the implicit callback used by the @code{\\tweak} command.


The example function defined below (\"display-grobs\") is probably not
that useful, but it demonstrates that the grobs are indeed being
accessed.


Example console output:


@code{ #Grob Accidental () #Grob Stem}
