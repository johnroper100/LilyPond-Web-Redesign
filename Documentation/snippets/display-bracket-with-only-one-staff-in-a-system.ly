If there is only one staff in one of the staff types @code{ChoirStaff}
or @code{StaffGroup}, by default the bracket and the starting bar line
will not be displayed.  This can be changed by overriding
@code{collapse-height} to set its value to be less than the number of
staff lines in the staff.

Note that in contexts such as @code{PianoStaff} and @code{GrandStaff}
where the systems begin with a brace instead of a bracket, another
property has to be set, as shown on the second system in the example.
