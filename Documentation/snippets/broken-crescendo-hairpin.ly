In order to make parts of a crescendo hairpin invisible, the following
method is used: A white rectangle is drawn on top of the respective
part of the crescendo hairpin, making it invisible.  The rectangle is
defined as postscript code within a text markup.

The markup command @code{with-dimensions} tells LilyPond to consider
only the bottom edge of the rectangle when spacing it against the
hairpin. The property @code{staff-padding} prevents the rectangle from
fitting between the hairpin and staff.

Make sure the hairpin is in a lower layer than the text markup to draw
the rectangle over the hairpin.
