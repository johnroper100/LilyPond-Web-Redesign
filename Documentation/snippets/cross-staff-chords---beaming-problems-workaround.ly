Sometimes it is better to use stems from the upper staff for creating
cross-staff chords, because no problems with automatic beam collision
avoidance then arise.  If the stems from the lower staff were used in
the following example, it would be necessary to change the automatic
beam collision avoidance settings so that it doesn't detect collisions
between staves using @code{\\override Staff.Beam.collision-voice-only =
##t}
