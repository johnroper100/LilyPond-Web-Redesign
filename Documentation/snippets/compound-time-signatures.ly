Odd 20th century time signatures (such as \"5/8\") can often be played
as compound time signatures (e.g. \"3/8 + 2/8\"), which combine two or
more inequal metrics.

LilyPond can make such music quite easy to read and play, by explicitly
printing the compound time signatures and adapting the automatic
beaming behavior.
