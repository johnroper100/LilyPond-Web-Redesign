This is for large examples that are included in the manual.  Most of these
examples are distinct snippets; files that are also included in the
regression tests should be copied from input/regression/ into this
direction and listed here.
- anything from LSR should be in Documentation/snippets/, though

- simple.ly isn't large, but it's included from
  scm/define-markup-commands.scm and should not be removed.

Do not use @ref{} in files in Documentation/included/;
cross-references should be made with specific macros such as
@rcontrib{}, @rextend{}, etc.  See Documentation/macros.itexi for a
complete list.
